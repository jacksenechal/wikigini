Wikified Geneology
------------------

WikiGini is a Ruby on Rails based genealogy application that operates on the wiki principle: all users edit the same record for an individual.

Status
------

This project is in pre-alpha state, meaning you won't find a full set of features to work with. At this point you can:

* Create, edit and delete people
* Add basic genealogical relationships
* Add basic personal information
* Navigate the family tree
* View change history

It is conspicuously missing:

* User accounts of any kind
* Editing permissions (open to the world)
* Relationship validations

Setup
-----

    bundle install
    rails server
